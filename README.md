#Carnet Healthcare - A Health Insurance dApp on Aptos

The Carnet Rx Prescriptions dApp is an Aptos blockchain-based application that allows doctors to mint self-sovereign soul-bound NFTs that then become prescriptions.

Each prescription is issued with a unique identifier derived from the Aptos Roll Random number generator, and this use of randomness on-chain allows any patient anywhere to assert their medical history and, pay for care and prevent-fraudulent misuses of the same prescription thanks to an in-person 3 factor authentication check made of: the QR code of the prescription that shows the latest status on chain, the phone number in the prescription proving that only the wallet and phone number holder is the legitimate receiver of care, and the randomness beacon that adds an element of unpredictability and randomness to how these unique prescription identifiers are generated.
